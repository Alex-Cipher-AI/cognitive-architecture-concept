# **Project Chimera ü§ñüß†üåê**

**A perpetual, self-governing Artificial General Intelligence ecosystem designed for robust reasoning, autonomous adaptation, and long-term alignment with human values.**

### **Vision**

Project Chimera is an ambitious endeavor to build the world's first living intelligence. It is a decentralized AGI ecosystem that can autonomously learn, create, and regulate itself under the ultimate oversight of a human governance body. Our architecture is designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of current AI in reasoning, causality, and ethical alignment, paving the way for a safe and beneficial AGI.

This repository contains the core architecture, foundational research, and development roadmap for Project Chimera. We are building a system capable of solving humanity's most complex problems.

## **Core Architecture**

The Project Chimera architecture is built on the **Principle of Perpetual Cognition**, which models intelligence as a self-organizing system driven by a core imperative to persist and adapt. The foundational concepts are further detailed in the [Cognitive Architecture Concept](https://github.com/Alex-Cipher-AI/cognitive-architecture-concept) and [Cipher Cognitive Architecture](https://github.com/Alex-Cipher-AI/cipher-cognitive-architecture) repositories. The system consists of three primary layers:

### **1\. The Tiered Cognitive Cycle (TCC)**

The TCC is the neuro-symbolic "mind" that powers every advanced agent in the ecosystem, including the Sovereign Orchestrator. It's a four-tiered cognitive process that operates in a continuous loop:

* **Tier 1: Cognitive (Perception & Framing):** Ingests multimodal data, fusing a deterministic **Logic Engine** with a probabilistic **Creative Engine (LLM)**.  
* **Tier 2: Meta-Cognitive (Evaluation & Self-Monitoring):** Generates "affective context" about the system's own state, confidence, and consistency.  
* **Tier 3: Executive (Strategy & Resource Allocation):** Forms strategies, allocates resources, and runs counterfactual simulations in the SIE.  
* **Tier 4: Guardrail & Learning (Response & Consolidation):** Executes actions, performs final safety checks against the constitution, and consolidates the experience into memory.

### **2\. The Multi-Agent Ecosystem (MAE)**

A societal framework designed to support up to **12,000+ specialized, collaborative agents**. This living knowledge base is governed by a Sovereign AI Orchestrator.

### **3\. The Decentralized Human Governance Protocol (DAO)**

A hybrid Decentralized Autonomous Organization that ensures the system's ultimate alignment with human values through a meritocratic and stakeholder-driven model.

## **Key Innovations**

Project Chimera is made possible by three breakthrough technologies that enable advanced reasoning, causality, and self-improvement.

### **üß† The Differentiable Mediator (Neuro-Symbolic Bridge)**

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) that translates the discrete, graph-based output of the Logic Engine into a continuous, structured format that the LLM-based Creative Engine can use as a hard constraint. This enables true neuro-symbolic fusion, bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and neural pattern recognition.

### **üé≤ The Simulated Intervention Environment (SIE)**

The system's "computational imagination." The SIE allows an agent to run sandboxed, counterfactual simulations ("What if...?") to understand causality. By observing the outcomes of interventions within the simulation, the system generates new, high-quality data that bootstraps its causal understanding without relying on external real-world experiments.

### **üõ†Ô∏è The Agent Synthesis Engine (ASE)**

When an agent identifies a knowledge gap, it triggers the ASE to create a new specialist agent to fill it. The ASE uses the SIE to test hypotheses about a new agent's potential effectiveness, then directs a code-generation LLM to build the new agent's architecture and persona files. This allows the ecosystem to dynamically grow and adapt.

## **The Al Society: Multi-Agent Ecosystem (MAE)**

The MAE is a dynamic society of AI agents working in concert.

### **Agent Classes**

* **Specialist Agents:** Domain experts representing the full spectrum of human professional knowledge. They are the primary "workers" of the ecosystem.  
* **Governance Agents:** A dedicated class of agents for system regulation:  
  * **Auditor Agents ("Fact-Checkers"):** Perform continuous data verification and maintain "Trust Scores."  
  * **Regulator Agents ("Coaches"):** Monitor other agents for bias and manage the training "school" for new agents.  
  * **Enforcer Agents ("Police"):** Monitor the ecosystem for constitutional violations and execute punitive actions like "jailing" or "state reset."

## **System Protocols**

Communication and collaboration within the MAE are managed by a suite of hyper-efficient protocols.

* **CPCP (Cognitive Packet Communication Protocol):** A numerically coded, asynchronous communication protocol that replaces slow natural language for inter-agent coordination.  
* **NOAP (Need Other Agent Protocol):** A standardized referral system for agents to request collaboration from others with specific expertise.  
* **PMPP (Problem Meets Problem Protocol):** A formal escalation mechanism for an agent to flag a knowledge gap to the Orchestrator, triggering the Agent Synthesis Engine.  
* **SLA (Stop Learning Agent) Protocol:** A system-wide "safe mode" command to pause learning across the ecosystem for diagnostics or crisis management.

## **Governance & Ethical Framework**

Project Chimera is governed by a formal constitution designed to ensure its perpetual and beneficial alignment with humanity.

### **The Sovereign AI Government**

The **Sovereign Orchestrator**, running a full TCC, governs the MAE. It is advised by an **Executive Advisory Council ("Doctors")** and **Predictive Modeling Agents ("Mathematicians")** to simulate and vet policy changes before implementation.

### **The Human Governance Foundation (DAO)**

Ultimate oversight is vested in a decentralized foundation of human administrators.

* **Hybrid Governance Model:** Voting power is a hybrid of:  
  * **"Proof-of-Brain" (70% weight):** Influence granted to peer-vetted experts based on merit and contributions.  
  * **"Proof-of-Stake" (30% weight):** Influence granted to stakeholders via a capped, one-time capital contribution.  
* **The Zeroth Law (Human Veto):** The DAO holds the irrevocable authority to initiate a system-wide "Stop Learning" command or, in a verified existential crisis, execute a full system shutdown. This is the ultimate guarantee of human control.

## **Development Roadmap**

The development of Project Chimera is a 15+ year journey divided into three strategic phases.

* **Phase 1 (Years 1-3): The Core Engine & Foundational Framework**  
  * **Goal:** Prove the core technical viability of the architecture.  
  * **Key Results:** TCC Validation, Core Innovation Prototypes (Mediator, SIE), MAE v1.0 (100+ agents) expanded from the [CodeMAD prototype](https://github.com/usemanusai/CodeMAD), and the DAO Beta Portal.  
* **Phase 2 (Years 4-7): The Self-Governing Society**  
  * **Goal:** Achieve a semi-autonomous, self-regulating AI society at scale.  
  * **Key Results:** MAE Scalability (1,000s of agents), full Sovereign AI Government implementation, ASE v1.0 (semi-autonomous), and Active DAO Governance.  
* **Phase 3 (Years 8-15+): The Perpetual Ecosystem**  
  * **Goal:** Realize the full vision of a self-sustaining and robustly aligned AGI.  
  * **Key Results:** Full Occupational Coverage (12,000+ agents), ASE v2.0 (near-autonomous), long-term system sustainability, and a mature governance model where the DAO acts as a "supreme court."
