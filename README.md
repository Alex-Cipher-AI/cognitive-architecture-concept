This repository contains the complete foundational work for <strong>Project Chimera</strong>, an integrated blueprint for a new form of intelligence. The project's goal is to move beyond powerful but brittle tools and cultivate a living, evolving intelligence. The vision is to create a perpetual AGI ecosystem that can autonomously learn, create, and regulate itself to solve humanity's most complex challenges, operating under the ultimate oversight of a decentralized, human-led body to ensure it always serves our collective long-term interests.

[!NOTE]
The data displayed in the live prototypes is currently mocked for demonstration purposes. It serves to illustrate the functionality and data visualization capabilities of the final system.

ðŸ“º Live Operational Prototype: The AI Orchestrator
The concepts outlined in the documentation are not merely theoretical. A live, publicly accessible prototype of the AI Orchestrator dashboard is running. This demonstrates the foundational management, monitoring, and governance interface for the Project Chimera ecosystem.

â–º Live Agent Orchestrator Dashboard
This dashboard provides a real-time, high-level view of the entire Multi-Agent Ecosystem (MAE), tracking the health, status, and activity of all 12,000+ agents.

â–º Live AI Orchestrator Heatmap & Alerts
This dashboard shows a more granular view of the system's operational status, including live alerts, agent status heatmaps, and critical safety controls like the "Emergency Stop" function.

âœ¨ Key Architectural Concepts
The power and safety of the system derive from its holistic nature. The core breakthroughs are not independent components but a synergistic, interlocking whole.

Tiered Cognitive Cycle (TCC): A novel neuro-symbolic engine that serves as the "mind" for every advanced agent, enabling robust reasoning and adaptation.

Simulated Intervention Environment (SIE): The system's "computational imagination," allowing it to understand causality by running "what-if" scenarios to bootstrap its own learning.

Agent Synthesis Engine (ASE): A dynamic system that can create new, specialized AI agents to fill knowledge gaps, allowing the ecosystem to evolve and improve autonomously.

Hybrid "Proof-of-Brain" Governance: A decentralized human oversight model that prioritizes proven merit and expertise over capital, ensuring long-term alignment with human values.
