## 🧠 Introduction

**Project Chimera** is a comprehensive blueprint for cultivating a **perpetual AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) ecosystem**—an intelligence that evolves, learns, and self-regulates autonomously. Unlike brittle tools of narrow AI, Chimera aspires to build a **living system** that can tackle humanity’s most complex challenges across generations.

Its core premise is holistic integration: cognition, ethics, and governance are not modular features but a **synergistic, interlocking system**. This design ensures both power and safety—intelligence governed by **a decentralized, human-led oversight body**, guaranteeing alignment with our long-term collective interests.

> _“Project Chimera is not a menu of features to be picked apart... Its power and safety derive from its holistic nature.”_

## 🧬 Core Architectural Components

Project Chimera’s architecture is designed as a **unified cognitive ecosystem**, where each layer supports and enhances the others.

### 🧩 Tiered Cognitive Cycle (TCC)
A neuro-symbolic reasoning engine that enables autonomous agents to think, learn, and act through recursive internal processing.

### 🧠 Simulated Intervention Environment (SIE)
A “computational imagination” engine allowing agents to simulate counterfactual scenarios and build causal understanding of their environment.

### 🧬 Agent Synthesis Engine (ASE)
Creates new agents on demand to fill strategic capability or knowledge gaps, enabling **organic evolution** of the system.

### 🗳 Hybrid "Proof-of-Brain" Governance
A decentralized governance layer prioritizing **expertise over capital**, ensuring decisions remain ethically sound and value-aligned.

## 🌐 Visionary Contribution

> _"I offer this work to the open community of thinkers, builders, and pioneers..."_

Project Chimera is more than just a technology stack—it is a **philosophical and systemic rethink** of artificial intelligence. The **neuro-symbolic engine**, the **causal simulation layer**, the **agent synthesis protocols**, and the **governance mechanisms** are deeply interconnected. Their interdependence is the source of both **robustness** and **ethical integrity**.

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage (Coming Soon)

Installation scripts and hands-on usage guides will be provided after core stabilization in the next development phase.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- Ensure required dependencies (e.g. simulation mocks, dashboard servers) are correctly mounted.
- For visual glitches, clear browser cache or disable ad-blockers.
- Use Chromium-based browsers for optimal dashboard rendering.
