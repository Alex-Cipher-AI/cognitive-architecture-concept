Cipher Cognitive Architecture - PrototypeA research prototype implementing the core components of the Cipher Cognitive Architecture, a novel framework designed to solve the "reasoning gap" in modern AI by enabling verifiable neuro-symbolic reasoning.ðŸ“– WhitepaperFor a comprehensive overview of the theory, architecture, and validation strategy behind this project, please see our full research paper:ðŸ“„ A Four-Tiered Cognitive Architecture for Advanced AI Reasoning1. Core ConceptCurrent Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation in multi-step logical deduction, leading to hallucinations and making them unreliable for high-stakes applications. This project implements and validates the core of the Cipher Cognitive Architecture, a framework designed to integrate deterministic symbolic reasoning with probabilistic neural networks in a unified, differentiable model.The full architecture is envisioned as four tiers: a Cognitive Tier for reasoning, a Meta-Cognitive Tier for self-monitoring, an Executive Tier for orchestration, and a Guardrail Tier for ethical oversight.The primary innovation validated in this prototype is the Differentiable Mediator. This component, implemented as a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention, bridges the gap between the symbolic Logic Engine and the neural Creative Engine (LLM). It is trained using multi-modal contrastive learning to create a shared semantic space, allowing the LLM's generative process to be directly and differentiably constrained by formal logic.2. Prototype ArchitectureThis repository contains the code for the Phase 1 prototype, a programmatic library that implements the core reasoning pipeline to validate the Cognitive Synergy Hypothesis.graph TD

3. Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.11+PyTorchGitInstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Alex-Cipher/cipher-cognitive-architecture.git
cd cipher-cognitive-architecture
Set up a virtual environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
4. UsageThe library is designed to be used programmatically. The following example demonstrates the core workflow.# main.py
from src.pipeline import CipherPipeline

def run_prototype():
    """
    Initializes and runs the full puzzle-solving pipeline.
    """
    # 1. Initialize the pipeline with a configuration file
    print("Initializing the Cipher Pipeline...")
    pipeline = CipherPipeline(config_path='config/default.yaml')

    # 2. Define the input logic puzzle
    # This would typically be loaded from a file or another source.
    puzzle_data = {
        "type": "LogicGridPuzzle",
        "entities": {
            "names": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
            "pets": ["cat", "dog", "fish"]
        },
        "clues": [
            "The person with the cat is not Alice.",
            "Bob has a dog."
        ]
    }
    print(f"\nSolving puzzle: {puzzle_data['type']}")

    # 3. Solve the puzzle
    print("Executing the reasoning pipeline...")
    solution_text = pipeline.solve_puzzle(puzzle_data)
    print("\n--- Generated Solution ---")
    print(solution_text)

    # 4. Get validation metrics
    metrics = pipeline.get_validation_metrics()
    print("\n--- Validation Metrics ---")
    print(metrics)

if __name__ == "__main__":
